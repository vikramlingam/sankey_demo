# ðŸ“Š Corporate Tax Flow Visualization with Plotly Sankey

This project demonstrates how to use **Python + Plotly** in **Google Colab** to create an interactive **Sankey diagram** that shows how corporate profit flows into taxable income, tax liability, and final net tax position (payable or refundable).

The idea:  
Revenue â†’ Gross Profit â†’ Operating Profit â†’ Profit Before Tax â†’ Tax Adjustments â†’ Taxable Income â†’ Tax Liability â†’ Net Tax.

- Clear step-by-step **Google Colab notebook** with comments.
- Easy to replace with **real company numbers** (Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, etc.).
- Outputs both **interactive HTML chart** and **summary CSV**.

## ðŸ”§ Customize with Real Data
To use real company financials:
1. Get income statement & tax disclosures (e.g., from 10-K, annual reports, or APIs like `yfinance`).
2. Replace the demo variables in the notebook (`revenue`, `cogs`, `op_expenses`, etc.).
3. Run all cells again â†’ the Sankey updates automatically.
